In a multiple linear regression analysis, the p-value for each individual predictor variable tests the null hypothesis that the coefficient for that variable is equal to zero (no effect). A small p-value (typically less than 0.05) indicates that there is strong evidence against the null hypothesis and that the variable is likely to be a meaningful predictor in the model. Conversely, a large p-value suggests that the variable is not a significant predictor.
It is important to keep in mind that a low p-value does not necessarily mean that a variable is causally related to the outcome. It simply means that there is a significant association between the predictor and outcome in the sample data.
